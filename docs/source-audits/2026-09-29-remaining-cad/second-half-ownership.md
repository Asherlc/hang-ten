# Parallel review ownership — 2026-10-01

Workspace and branch: `placid-badger-cad-second-half`, based on
`9399160729fcc418cedf47344b41163d244b5d96`.

This workspace exclusively reviews #16 `yy-baguette`, #17 `yy-baguette-evo`,
#18 `yy-penta-evo`, #19 `yy-travelboard`, #20 `zlagboard-evo`, and
#21 `zlagboard-pro`, in that order, one board at a time with the user.
#16 was accepted by the user on 2026-10-01 (reply “y”, displayed commit
`a77034f`). #17 was accepted on 2026-10-01 (reply “y”, displayed commit `112121501`).
#18–21 remain pending until explicit replies accept their revisions.

The parent `placid-badger` owns #9–15; accepted #1–8 and all other packages
are outside this workspace's scope. Shared compiler, schema, renderer, and
rope-solver changes require coordination with the parent. Global queue and
delivery metadata edits must preserve all other package records. Integration
must retain both branches' substantive review records.

Scratch belongs under `.context/placid-badger-cad-second-half/`. Temporary
validation simulators carry this exact workspace name, are registered before
use, and are deleted by verified cleanup traps. This workspace and review
agent remain available; they are not temporary validation resources.

Every commit is pushed to this branch. No merge to main or the parent branch
is authorized by this allocation.

For #18, the parent explicitly coordinated the additive `terminalsByPoseID`
authoring extension with this branch. The parent retains `grooveGuides`; combining
the two is rejected. Later explicit integration must preserve its optional
`source_metadata` argument, guide dispatch and validation, alongside this
branch's pose station validation/tests and dispatch before route caching.
Coordination is retained in #18's package-local review packet.

### #18 workout pairing correction

Fresh Penta Evo workout validation exposed an existing resolver assumption: two
reused unit contacts share a local descriptor frame, so spatial bilateral
selection fails. Parent confirmed no overlapping edit to
`WorkoutActivityRecording.swift` and authorized the narrow corresponding-slot
instance branch with positive/negative regressions. Package geometry, source
facts, routine prescriptions and renderer remain unchanged by this fix. Preserve
this addition alongside the parent's independent changes at a later explicitly
authorized merge. Exact coordination is retained in #18's individual packet.
